I received a Bachelors Degree with First Class Honours in  Mechatronic Engineering from the University of Manchester in 2023.

I am currently a 2nd Year Postgraduate Researcher at the University of Manchester with the Centre for Robotic Autonomy in Demanding and Long-lasting Environments (CRADLE)

Research
======
My PhD research focuses on developing a control framework for the bimanual manipulation of two independent underwater vehicle-manipulator systems. The framework
will aim to allow for the intuitive definition of a general bimanual manipulation task while also accounting for the system's intrinsic constraints, environmental
constraints and task-specific limitations. With direct applications in underwater industries such as offshore inspection and maintenance, and nuclear pond decommissioning, or any industry where cooperative
manipulation could be used.
