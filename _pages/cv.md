Education
======
* Pursuing a Ph.D in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester (2023 - Now)
* BEng in Mechatronic Engineering, 2023
  * Thesis title: Implementation of a Constrained Task-Space Trajectory Tracking Controller for a Drawing Robot
    * Simulated a 7 DoF robotic serial manipulator drawing a user-defined shape in CoppeliaSim using dual quaternion algebra
    * Used a kinematic controller that implemented a linearly-constrained quadratic optimization problem
    * Defined task-space and joint-space constraints using vector-field inequalities and geometric primitives defined in the dual quaternion space for collision avoidance 
 
Non-academic experience
======
* [06/2022 - 09/2022] Summer Internship at Labman Automation
  * Led the end-to-end development of a product for an international client
  * Designed the concept from the ground up, overseeing planning and execution
  * Managed the manufacturing and iterative testing process to refine the design
  * Compiled and presented key findings and recommendations to the client
